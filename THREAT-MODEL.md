# Threat model

What this library defends against, what it cannot, and what it hands to you.

## What it is

A Go client for LNURLcash bearer notes. It builds requests, classifies
responses, generates replacement note secrets, and verifies mint signatures
offline. It holds no state between calls.

## Assets

**Spends (`k1`).** Every note is a taproot output key `Q`, and a spend opens
it: a bearer note's preimage (or its full `cw1`), a `ck1` signed by a note
key, or a `cw1` satisfying some other leaf. Bearer instruments: whoever holds
one can spend it, with no further authentication. A bearer preimage works at
any mint that holds its note; a `ck1` only at the mint whose domain it
signed. Compromise is theft, and it is silent and irreversible: the money is
gone before the previous holder has any way to notice.

**Note keys and address branches.** A note key signs its `ck1`, so it is the
note. An address node derives every note key on its branch.

**Replacement secrets awaiting confirmation.** After a mutation whose outcome
is unknown, the secrets generated in-process may be the only copies of notes
a service has already minted. Losing them destroys the money exactly as
thoroughly as leaking them gives it away.

**Mint pubkeys.** Not secret, but a wrong one makes offline verification
meaningless.

## Trust boundaries

| Party | Trusted for |
| --- | --- |
| the SERVICE (mint) | custody of the sats, and honest accounting. Nothing else. |
| the caller's storage | confidentiality and durability of secrets. This library provides neither. |
| the caller's RNG | unpredictability of replacement secrets. Substitutable, and load-bearing. |
| the network | nothing. |

A mint is trusted with custody by construction — it holds the funds. It is
*not* trusted to describe them accurately, which is why value comes from
`maxWithdrawable` rather than from a note URL's own `amount`, and why a
signed note can be checked against a key the mint published earlier.

## What this library defends against

**A service that keeps a copy of your note.** Rotate, split and merge disclose
only a public name for each output: a `cp1`, or a bearer note's
`h = sha256(preimage)`, from which the service computes the note's `Q`. It
files the note under `hex(Q)` and never sees what spends it. This is the
difference between a bearer note and a receipt, and it is why a
service-generated replacement is refused even when offered
(`serverGeneratedSecrets` in the mock mint exercises exactly this).

**A spend replayed at another mint.** A `ck1` signs the key-path sighash of a
canonical transaction whose prevout is `tagged_hash("LNURLcash/mint",
domain)`, so a signature one mint has seen verifies nowhere else.
`SignNoteOwnership` takes the domain from whatever URL or host it is given
and keeps only the lowercase hostname, so a scheme, a port or a case
difference cannot silently sign for a mint that does not exist. A register
or unregister proof binds the domain the same way. A bearer note's spend
signs nothing and is bound to no mint: it spends its note wherever the note
exists, exactly as a plain `k1` always has.

**A spend that does not open its note.** `VerifySpend` checks a spend the way
a mint does: a `ck1`'s signature for the domain, a `cw1`'s control block
(merkle path, tweak and parity) against `Q`, the leaf rules, and a bearer
leaf's hashlock. `ResolveNoteInput` and the informational GET's echo check
use it, so a `ck1` for another mint, or one with the right key and a broken
signature, is not taken for the note.

**An upgrade-hook leaf.** A leaf version other than `0xc0`, or an
`OP_SUCCESSx` opcode outside pushed data, succeeds unconditionally under
consensus today, so anyone who saw such a leaf could spend it. Both are
refused (`CheckLeafPolicy`), as LUD-25 has a mint refuse them.

**A cp1 nobody could spend.** A `cp1` whose key is not a curve point is
refused on decode, so a mint invoice to one is never requested and never
paid.

**A mutation whose outcome is unknown.** Timeouts, dropped connections,
unreadable bodies and unconfirmed 200s are all raised as
`AmbiguousMutationError` carrying the fresh secrets, never as failure.
Requests that provably never left — offline mode, a refused URL, an
unparseable callback — are raised as `RequestRefusedError` instead, which is
safe to treat as "nothing happened".

**A note that answers its own questions.** Every URL fetched, whether scanned
by a user or supplied by a service in its own response, must be https, or
http to loopback or `.onion`. A `data:` URL carrying withdrawRequest JSON
would otherwise mint a self-contained fake note that verifies against
nothing.

**A service that inflates a note.** A certificate (`cs1`) commits to the
amount and to the note's `hex(Q)`, for every note, a bearer note included. A
service reporting more than it signed fails verification, without the holder
contacting anyone. A certificate over a bearer note's `h`, the message mints
used before notes were keyed by `Q`, is still read and reported as
`CertifiedOverHash`, so a caller can tell a mint that has not caught up.

**A service that swaps your note.** The informational GET checks that the
echoed `k1` is the one queried, or another spend that opens the same `Q` at
that mint. Anything else means either a non-compliant service or a note
redeemed by somebody else.

**A secret leaking through a query string.** `sig` is stripped before the
informational GET, since the service already knows what it signed.

**A hostile fee advertisement.** Fees of 100% or more are refused at parse
time, and the gross-up search is a binary search rather than a walk — so a
service cannot stall a caller with an extreme fee.

**Integer overflow on realistic amounts.** The proportional fee term is
computed split, because 21M BTC in msat times a high ppm exceeds 64-bit
unsigned. Ports that multiply naively pass every small test and mangle large
ones; the conformance vectors include a case that catches it.

## What it does not defend against

**Storage compromise.** This library never persists anything. If your
storage is readable — an unencrypted database, a synced folder, a debugger,
a crash dump — every note in it is spendable by whoever reads it. Encrypt at
rest, and treat backups as the same exposure.

**A weak RNG.** `Client.Secrets` is replaceable, which means it can be replaced
badly. A predictable secret is a note anyone can mint themselves. Use the
platform CSPRNG, or a hardware RNG, and nothing else.

**Secrets in logs.** A note URL carries its secret in a query string. A
request logger, an error reporter, a crash handler or an analytics SDK that
records URLs records bearer money. This library never logs; what wraps it
might.

**A malicious or compromised mint.** It holds the funds. It can refuse to
honour a note, vanish, or inflate its liabilities. Offline verification
proves what it *said*, which is useful for exposing it afterwards, and is
not custody.

**The mint-time preimage race.** A freshly minted note's secret is the
invoice preimage, so the service has necessarily seen it, and anyone who saw
the unpaid invoice can poll LUD-21 `verify` for it the moment it settles.
Rotating immediately wins that race; a slow manual flow does not. Do not
publish unpaid mint invoices.

**Traffic analysis.** Every operation reaches the mint directly. The mint
learns your IP, your timing, and which notes move together. Notes are bearer
instruments, not private ones — merging several notes tells the mint they
had one holder. Route over Tor if that matters.

**Anything about the sats themselves.** No custody, no channel management,
no payment routing.

**Leaves this library cannot run.** There is no script interpreter here. A
`cw1` whose leaf is not a bearer hashlock is checked for structure, `Q` and
the leaf rules only, and `VerifySpend` says so (`Unevaluated`);
`VerifyNoteSignature` refuses to vouch for one. Only the mint, running
consensus rules, decides whether its witness satisfies the leaf.

**Timelocks.** A timelock a mint honours is the mint asserting its own clock:
a custodial policy, never a trustless guarantee. `CheckTimeClaim` only
predicts what an honest mint's clock will say.

## Go's retry hazard

Every LNURLcash mutation is an HTTP GET, and HTTP considers GET idempotent, so
a transport may resend one when a connection fails mid-flight. An LNURLcash
mutation is not idempotent: the first attempt burns the input.

A retried mutation therefore gets "already spent" for its second attempt, which
classifies as a *definitive rejection*. A caller then discards the fresh secret
that was the only copy of the note the service had just minted.

`net/http` does this when the request was sent on a **reused** connection - and
a client with no `Transport` of its own uses `http.DefaultTransport`, whose
pool is shared process-wide. Whether a mutation is silently retried therefore
depends on whether unrelated code happened to talk to the same host first.

`NewClient` sets `DisableKeepAlives`, which removes the only condition under
which `net/http` retries. **A caller supplying its own client must do the
same**, and a caller adding a retrying round-tripper, a resilience library, or
a service mesh with automatic retries must exclude these requests from it.

The same hazard applies to any LNURLcash client on any platform whose HTTP
stack retries idempotent methods, and it has bitten this project in two
languages already.

## Deliberate design choices

**Both signature recovery-id orderings are accepted.** The wire format is
`r || s || recovery_id`; lnurl-mint once emitted the reverse. Trying both is
not a weakening: recovering under the wrong ordering yields an unrelated
pubkey, which cannot match the expected one.

**Errors are typed by whether the request could have been processed**, not by
transport detail. That distinction is the whole safety model, and message
text is not a stable interface — never branch on it.

**No global state.** Offline mode, timeout, HTTP client and RNG are fields on
`Client`. A caller that wants certainty nothing reaches the network sets
`Offline` and gets a refusal, rather than trusting that no code path happens to
make a request.

**The protocol layer has no I/O.** `Request`/`Parse` pairs cannot reach the
network even by accident, so a caller with its own transport never has to trust
this package with a socket.

**The HTTP client does not reuse connections.** See below - this is the
sharpest edge in Go.
